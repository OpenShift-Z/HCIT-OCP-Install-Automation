- Remove the "help-wanted" tag from the Issue

### Work on an Issue

- Attend Dev Team Sync
- Update your progress in the issue
- Communicate w anyone who is working on non-dev work connected to the issue (they should also be assigned to the issue)
- Fork the repository to create a copy to work off
- In your fork, checkout a new branch off **"main"** and name the branch after the issue number, and add your initials to the end (ex. issue-83-mw)

### Pull Request Process

- Commit your local changes to your branch
- Make sure your fork is up-to-date with the most recent changes on **"main"**
- Push your branch/changes to github
- Open up a new PR with your fork against the main repository's **"dev"** branch
- Update the PR with any necessary details, what you worked on, any issues/changes/pivots, additional technologies used, references to resources/docs, etc.
- Add the issue you're assigned to your PR so it will be closed automatically when your PR is merged
- Team members may add comments/questions as needed for your review
- Complete any requested revisions in a timely manner
- Your PR will be merged by the Dev Team Lead according to the deployment schedule

## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:
- Open a new issue providing as much info as possible 
- Add any screenshots and resources to properly document the issue
- Include the necessary steps that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error for review and testing
- Poke a maintainer if the issue isn't acknowledged in a timely manner

Once it's filed:
- A team member will label the issue.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as needs-repro. Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked needs-fix, as well as possibly other tags (such as critical), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.
- If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the issue will be closed. If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.
- `critical`  issues may be left open, depending on perceived immediacy and severity, even past the 30 day deadline.
- The team has regular scrum meetings and will groom the issue into the backlog accordingly.
